# 02901 - Advanced Topics in Machine Learning


This is the code that I developed for the course.

## Usage
All the relevant code is located in the python_code folder/models

cca_cluster.py calls the regularized cca implementation from cca.py and computes the results.

analyze_cca.py makes the plots.

## Videos
We can reconstruct and visualize the movements of the faces, that each components learn to extract.
